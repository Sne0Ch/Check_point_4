The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database is a Canada-UK Project which contains targeted sequencing data of 1,980 primary breast cancer samples. Clinical and genomic data was downloaded from cBioPortal.
The dataset was collected by Professor Carlos Caldas from Cambridge Research Institute and Professor Sam Aparicio from the British Columbia Cancer Centre in Canada and published on Nature Communications (Pereira et al., 2016).
